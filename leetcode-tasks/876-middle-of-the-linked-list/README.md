[876. Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return _the middle node_ of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return __the second middle__ node.

__Example 1:__

    ![images](./../../images/876-middle-of-the-linked-list-1.jpg)

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [3,4,5]
    Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

__Example 2:__

    ![images](./../../images/876-middle-of-the-linked-list-2.jpg)

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    Output: [4,5,6]
    Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

__Constraints:__

-    The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
-    $1 \leq $ `Node.val` $ \leq 100$
